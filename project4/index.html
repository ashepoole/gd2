                <p>Veronika Burian first got her degree in Industrial Design in Munich, Germany, before moving on to
                    Austria and Italy to work as a mix between a product and graphic designer. Discovering her true
                    passion for type, Veronika enrolled in the MA in Typeface Design at the University of Reading, UK.
                    Upon graduating with distinction in 2003, she worked as a full-time type designer at Dalton Maag in
                    London for a few years. She now dedicates her time fully to TypeTogether, the independent type label
                    she co-founded with José Scaglione.

                <p>Zuzana Licko was born in 1961 in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia and emigrated with her parents to the
                    U.S. in 1968. She graduated with a degree in Graphic Communications from the University of
                    California at Berkeley in 1984. Together with her husband, Rudy VanderLans, Licko started the design
                    company Emigre Graphics in 1984. The company became world renowned for its self-published magazine
                    and type foundry which were greatly inspired by the new technical possibilities offered by the
                    introduction of the Macintosh computer.
