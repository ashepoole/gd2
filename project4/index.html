            <p>This is a bold, brief, and fully typographic paragraph about the convention. It explains why the
                conference
                is important, and grabs the viewer’s attention with it’s complete absurdity.</p>

                <h3>Veronika Burian</h3>
                <p>Made to Fit</p>
                <p>2:00 PM</p>
                <p>August 28th</p>
                <p>Born in Prague, Veronika Burian first got her degree in Industrial Design in Munich, Germany, before
                    moving on to Austria and Italy to work as a mix between a product and graphic designer. Discovering
                    her
                    true passion for type, Veronika enrolled in the MA in Typeface Design at the University of Reading,
                    UK.
                    Upon graduating with distinction in 2003, she worked as a full-time type designer at Dalton Maag in
                    London for a few years. After residing in Boulder, Colorado for some time, she moved back to her
                    hometown Prague and is now living and working in Spain. She dedicates her time fully to
                    TypeTogether,
                    the independent type label she co-founded with José Scaglione. Veronika is also an educator, giving
                    lectures and workshops at international conferences and universities. Her typeface Maiola received,
                    amongst others, the TDC Certificate of Excellence in Type Design in 2004. Several other typefaces by
                    TypeTogether have also been recognised in international type competitions.

                <h3>Zuzana Licko</h3>
                <p>Discovery by Design</p>
                <p>3:30 PM</p>
                <p>August 28th</p>
                <p>Zuzana Licko was born in 1961 in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia and emigrated with her parents to the
                    U.S. in
                    1968. She graduated with a degree in Graphic Communications from the University of California at
                    Berkeley in 1984. Together with her husband, Rudy VanderLans, Licko started the design company
                    Emigre
                    Graphics in 1984. The company became world renowned for its self-published magazine and type foundry
                    which were greatly inspired by the new technical possibilities offered by the introduction of the
                    Macintosh computer. Licko and VanderLans became early adopters to the new technology and they used
                    the
                    computer to experiment and created some of the very first typeface designs and digital page layouts
                    causing great consternation within the realm of graphic design. Eventually, exposure of the
                    typefaces in
                    Emigre magazine resulted in demand for the fonts which lead to the creation of the Emigre Type
                    foundry.
                    This growing library of digital typefaces, both experimental and traditional, is currently the
                    principle
                    activity and mainstay of Emigre.
