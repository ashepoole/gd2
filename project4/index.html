            <h2 class="sr-only">About Women in Type</h2>
            <p>In 2018, MICA exhibited a collection of <a href="https://www.design-research.be/by-womxn/">Badass Libre
                    Fonts By Womxn,</a> curated by Loraine Furter and brought to MICA by Ellen Lupton, director of the
                school's Graphic Design MFA Program. Now, in 2019, we wish to continue to build on this legacy by giving
                a platform to current female type designers, who are often forgotten in the traditionally conservative
                field of typography.</p>

                <p class="event-description">Veronika Burian first got her degree in Industrial Design in Munich,
                    Germany, before moving on to Austria and Italy to work as a mix between a product and graphic
                    designer. Discovering her true passion for type, Veronika enrolled in the MA in Typeface Design at
                    the University of Reading, UK. Upon graduating with distinction in 2003, she worked as a full-time
                    type designer at Dalton Maag in London for a few years. She now dedicates her time fully to
                    TypeTogether, the independent type label she co-founded with José Scaglione.

                <p class="event-description">Zuzana Licko was born in 1961 in Czechoslovakia and emigrated with her
                    parents to the U.S. in 1968. She graduated with a degree in Graphic Communications from the
                    University of California at Berkeley in 1984. Together with her husband, Rudy VanderLans, Licko
                    started the design company Emigre Graphics in 1984. The company became world renowned for its
                    self-published magazine and type foundry which were greatly inspired by the new technical
                    possibilities offered by the the 1984 Macintosh computer.
