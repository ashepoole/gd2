                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 fresh lemon <span>($0.30)</span></li>
                    <li>1.25 cups all-purpose flour <span>($0.13)</span></li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp salt <span>($0.02)</span></li>
                    <li>3/4 cup powdered sugar, divided <span>($0.15)</span></li>
                    <li>2 tsp baking powder <span>($0.08)</span></li>
                    <li>2 tsp poppy seeds <span>($0.20)</span></li>
                    <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream <span>($1.83)</span></li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Use a small-holed cheese grater
                        or a zester to remove the zest from the lemon, then squeeze the juice into a separate bowl.
                        You'll need about 1 tsp of zest and 1 Tbsp juice.
                    </li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, stir together the flour, salt, 1/4 cup powdered sugar, baking powder, poppy
                        seeds,and 1 tsp lemon zest. Make sure these ingredients are well combined.
                    </li>
                    <li>Stir the cream into the dry ingredients until a shaggy ball of dough forms. The dough will be
                        fairly sticky. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, divide it into three pieces, and shape
                        each piece into a disc (about 3 inches diameter). Cut each disc into six triangles.
                    </li>
                    <li>Arrange the cut scones on the prepared baking sheet. Bake the scones for about 15 minutes, or
                        until they just begin to barely turn golden brown on top.
                    </li>
                    <li>While the scones are baking, place the remaining 1/2 cup powdered sugar in a bowl. Stir in about
                        1 Tbsp lemon juice, or just enough to form a thick glaze.
                    </li>
                    <li>When the scones have baked, remove them from the oven, let them cool, then drizzle with the
                        prepared lemon glaze.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <h4>Sesame Dressing</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 Tbsp neutral salad oil<em>*</em> <span>($0.04)</span></li>
                    <li>1 Tbsp rice vinegar <span>($0.12)</span></li>
                    <li>3 Tbsp soy sauce <span>($0.39)</span></li>
                    <li>1/2 Tbsp toasted sesame oil <span>($0.16)</span></li>
                    <li>1.5 Tbsp brown sugar <span>($0.03)</span></li>
                    <li>1 tsp grated fresh ginger <span>($0.04)</span></li>
                    <li>1/2 Tbsp sesame seeds <span>($0.04)</span></li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Slaw</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>6 cups shredded red cabbage <span>($1.09)</span></li>
                    <li>1 large carrot <span>($0.11)</span></li>
                    <li>1 red bell pepper <span>($1.89)</span></li>
                    <li>1/2 bunch green onion <span>($0.50)</span></li>
                    <li>1 cup frozen shelled edamame <span>($0.67)</span></li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare the dressing first to allow the flavors time to blend. Place the neutral oil, vinegar,
                        soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, brown sugar, ginger, and sesame seeds in a jar or other small
                        container with a lid, and shake until combined. Set the dressing aside.
                    </li>
                    <li>Shred the cabbage as finely as possible. Use a large-holed cheese grater, mandolin, or food
                        processor to shred the carrot. Finely dice the bell pepper, and slice the green onion. Cook the
                        edamame according to the package directions (mine required microwaving for 5 minutes).
                    </li>
                    <li>Place all the vegetables in a large bowl and pour about half the dressing over top. Toss the
                        ingredients together until everything is combined and coated in dressing. Taste and add more
                        dressing if desired (I used about 3/4 of the dressing). Serve immediately or refrigerate until
                        you're ready to eat. Always stir the slaw just before serving to redistribute the dressing.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Notes</h3>
                <p>*Neutral salad oils do not have a strong flavor, and are a great base for dressing to allow other
                    flavors to shine. Oils like canola, grapeseed oil, light olive oil, or safflower oil.

                <h4>White Sauce</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 Tbsp butter <span>($0.09)</span></li>
                    <li>1 Tbsp all-purpose flour <span>($0.01)</span></li>
                    <li>1 cup whole milk <span>($0.31)</span></li>
                    <li>1/8 tsp garlic powder <span>($0.02)</span></li>
                    <li>1/4 tsp salt <span>($0.01)</span></li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Pizza</h4>

                            Pizza Crust</a>* <span>($0.30)</span></li>
                    <li>1/4 lb. frozen spinach, thawed (about 1 to 1.5 cups) <span>($0.43)</span></li>
                    <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella <span>($0.63)</span></li>
                    <li>4 large eggs <span>($1.03)</span></li>
                    <li>Freshly cracked pepper <span>($0.02)</span></li>
                    <li>1/2 Tbsp cornmeal (for pizza pan--optional) <span>($0.02)</span></li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Instructions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Adjust your oven rack to the highest level. Begin to preheat the oven to 500 degrees.
                    </li>
                    <li>To make the white sauce, combine the butter and flour in a small sauce pot. Heat the butter and
                        flour over medium-low heat, while whisking, until it begins to simmer. Simmer and whisk the
                        mixture for about one minute.
                    </li>
                    <li>Whisk the milk into the butter and flour mixture. Allow it to come up to a simmer again,
                        whisking often. When it reaches a simmer, it will thicken. Turn off the heat and whisk in the
                        garlic and salt. Set the sauce aside to cool (it will thicken further as it cools).
                    </li>
                    <li>Prepare a 12-inch pizza pan with non-stick spray and/or cornmeal. Stretch the pizza dough out to
                        cover the surface of the pizza pan. Pour the white sauce over the surface and spread it out with
                        the back of a spoon. Bake the crust with the sauce for 5 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>Squeeze any excess moisture out of the spinach, then sprinkle the spinach over the surface of
                        the par-baked pizza crust and sauce, followed by half of the mozzarella. Crack the four eggs
                        onto the pizza, equally spaced around the surface. Add a small amount of freshly cracked pepper,
                        then top the remainder of the mozzarella.
                    </li>
                    <li>Bake the pizza for 10-12 minutes, or until the cheese and crust are golden brown and the eggs
                        are mostly set. Allow the pizza to cool for five minutes before slicing (the eggs will continue
                        to firm up after it comes out of the oven).
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Notes</h3>
                <p>You can use any type of pizza crust you like, but cooking time may vary. The ingredients listed are
                    enough for a 12-inch pizza.</p>

                    <li>6 cups chicken broth* <span>($0.78)</span></li>
                    <li>2 10oz. cans diced tomatoes with green chiles (Rotel) <span>($0.90)</span></li>
                    <li>1 tsp oregano <span>($0.10)</span></li>

                    <li>1/2 bunch cilantro <span>($0.40)</span></li>
                    <li>1 avocado <span>($1.50)</span></li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Dice the onion, celery, and jalapeño (scrape the seeds out of the jalapeño before dicing). Mince
                        the garlic. Add the onion, celery, jalapeño, garlic, and olive oil to a large soup pot and cook
                        over medium heat for about 5 minutes, or until the onions are soft and translucent.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add the chicken breast, chicken broth, diced tomatoes with chiles (with juices), oregano, and
                        cumin to the pot. Place a lid on the pot, turn the heat up to high, and bring the broth up to a
                        boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to low and let the pot simmer for 45 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>After simmering for 45 minutes, carefully remove the chicken breast from the pot and use two
                        forks to shred the meat. Return the shredded meat to the pot. Squeeze the juice of one lime into
                        the soup (2-3 Tbsp juice).
                    </li>
                    <li>Rinse the cilantro and then roughly chop the leaves. Add the chopped cilantro to the soup, give
                        it a quick stir, then serve. Slice the avocado and add a few slices to each bowl.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Notes</h3>
                <p>*I use Better Than Bouillon chicken soup base to make my broth because it is less expensive than
                    buying canned or boxed broths.
